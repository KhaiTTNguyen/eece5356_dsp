AR Model Inverse Filter Homework

In the matlab file ARModelInverseFilter.mat are two signals named:

ytrain
y

You are to model an unknown communications channel.  All you know about it is that it is a third-order AR model.  That is to say, it's system function is H(z) = 1/A(z) where A(z) is a third order polynomial. You are to estimate the coefficients of this polynomial.

A random noise signal was used as an input to the channel and the resulting signal, ytrain, has been observed.  Using ytrain, estimate the coefficients of A(z).

A data signal was then put at the input of the channel and the received signal was observed to be y.  Using your estimated A(z), inverse filter the received y to estimate the original input signal x.  

Plot both y and x.

Turn in the plots and the matlab code (i.e., the program you write) you used to solve this.
